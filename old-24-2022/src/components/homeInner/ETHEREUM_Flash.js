                    <p>Since the transaction ordering process in
                        ETH 2.0 will be the same as that of oW
                        Ethereum (ETH 1.0), the same principles
                        will apply. The difference lies in ho has
                        ultimate control over the ordering,
                        namely validators rather than iners.
                        Instead of tipping the miner, once ETH
                        2.0 is released it will then be the
                        validator</p>
