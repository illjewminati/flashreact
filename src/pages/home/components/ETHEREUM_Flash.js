                    <p>Account abstraction is a concept that allows users to send transactions without having to worry about the underlying blockchain technology. Leveraging private relays and account abstraction, users can use any token as gas to pay for transactions privately and securely, which can reduce fees and simplify the transaction process. This can also allow for greater flexibility in the types of transactions that can be performed.</p>
